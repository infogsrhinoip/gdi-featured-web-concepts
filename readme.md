# JS203: Client-side APIs

Slides and materials are hosted [here](http://gdichicago.com/classes/js203/workshop/).

## Course description

An API is a service that lets one website use data or functionality from another website, and most modern webpages rely on at least one API - like the Facebook API for social interaction, the Google Analytics API for tracking, or the DoubleClick API for ads. In this workshop, we'll talk about how JavaScript-based APIs actually work behind the scenes, and give you some hands-on experience in using them, plus introduce you to a wealth of APIs to enhance your websites.

This is intended to be a follow-up workshop for JS101, JS201, and JS202 or for those already comfortable with JavaScript, jQuery, and AJAX requests looking to expand their skills. See the prerequisites section below for details.


**Cost:** $40

**Dates:** Sunday, July 13 from 12-3:30 PM

**Location:** Dev Bootcamp, 351 W Hubbard, Floor 7
